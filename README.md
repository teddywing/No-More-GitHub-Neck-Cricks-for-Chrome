No More GitHub Neck Cricks for Chrome
=====================================

A Google Chrome browser extension that rotates the [GitHub](https://github.com) Network Graph 90 degrees so that branch names are horizontal and easier to read.


# Installing
To install the extension, open the Extensions window in Chrome and click 'Load unpacked extensionâ€¦". In the file browser select the directory of this project.


# Help! Mouse-dragging is all weird!
The graph may be rotated, but the controls aren't. Here's a handy translation key.

## Mouse dragging
* UP: graph moves RIGHT
* DOWN: graph moves LEFT
* LEFT: graph moves UP
* RIGHT: graph moves DOWN

## Arrow keys (keyboard)
* UP: graph moves LEFT
* DOWN: graph moves RIGHT
* LEFT: graph moves UP
* RIGHT: graph moves DOWN
